# Fixes Applied to Hotel Reservation System

## Summary of Fixes

All compilation and runtime errors have been resolved in the Hotel Reservation System project.

## 1. Enum Visibility Fix

**Problem:** Enums were not accessible causing `Cannot access com.hotel.reservation.entity.Reservation.ReservationStatus` error.

**Solution:** Made all nested enums `public static` in:
- `Reservation.java` - `ReservationStatus` enum
- `Room.java` - `RoomType` enum
- `User.java` - `Role` enum

## 2. Thymeleaf Spring Security Integration

**Problem:** Template was trying to access `#authentication.isAuthenticated()` on null context.

**Solution:** 
- Added `thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity6` dependency to `pom.xml`
- Updated templates to use `sec:` namespace instead of `#authentication`
- Changed from `th:if="${#authentication.isAuthenticated()}"` to `sec:authorize="isAuthenticated()"`

## 3. Missing Templates

**Problem:** `guest/dashboard.html` template was missing.

**Solution:** Created `guest/dashboard.html` with proper Spring Security integration and guest-specific features.

## 4. Template Updates

Updated the following templates to use proper Spring Security Thymeleaf integration:
- `home.html` - Added `xmlns:sec` namespace and updated authentication checks
- `layout.html` - Added `xmlns:sec` namespace and updated navigation
- Created `guest/dashboard.html` - Complete guest dashboard with security integration

## 5. Security Configuration Updates

Updated `SecurityConfig.java` to:
- Allow `/auth/**` endpoints for public access
- Allow `/rooms/**` endpoints for room browsing
- Proper role-based access control

## 6. MySQL Connector Update

Updated from deprecated `mysql-connector-java` to `mysql-connector-j` for Spring Boot 3.x compatibility.

## Files Modified

### Java Files:
1. `src/main/java/com/hotel/reservation/entity/Reservation.java`
2. `src/main/java/com/hotel/reservation/entity/Room.java`
3. `src/main/java/com/hotel/reservation/entity/User.java`
4. `src/main/java/com/hotel/reservation/config/SecurityConfig.java`

### Configuration Files:
1. `pom.xml` - Added Thymeleaf Spring Security dependency and updated MySQL connector

### Template Files:

2. `src/main/resources/templates/layout.html`
3. Created `src/main/resources/templates/guest/dashboard.html`

## Testing the Fixes

The application should now:
1. Compile without errors
2. Run successfully on port 8080
3. Allow users to login and access their dashboard
4. Display proper authentication status in navigation
5. Show guest dashboard for guest users and admin dashboard for admin users

## Demo Credentials

**Guest:**
- Username: `guest`
- Password: `password`

**Admin:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

## Next Steps

1. Restart the application
2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`
3. Test login with the demo credentials
4. Verify that the dashboard loads properly for both guest and admin users
